# User guide

## Install the CLI

The official Corn CLI can be installed using cargo:

```sh
cargo install corn-cli
```

This installs a binary named `corn`.

The CLI can take input from `.corn` files or stdin, and parse it into JSON, YAML or TOML.
This allows you to write Corn and use it in existing solutions straight away.

For example:

```sh
corn my-file.corn -t yaml
```

Use `corn --help` to view all options.

## Install a Library

Corn can be integrated into your project with a library.

### Rust

Add the latest version of `libcorn` from Crates.io to your project:

```sh
cargo add libcorn
```

The library supports deserialization via `serde`:


```rust
use serde::Deserialize;

#[derive(Deserialize)]
struct Config {
    foo: u8
}

fn main() {
    let corn = "{foo = 42}";
    let config = corn::from_str::<Config>(corn)?;
    assert_eq!(config.foo, 42);
}

```

You can also use `corn::parse` to output an AST in the form of the `corn::Value` enum.
This can be serialized or used to **TODO**

```rust
fn main() {
    let corn = "{foo = 42}";
    let config: Value = corn::parse(corn)?;
}
```

For full details, see the [docs](https://docs.rs/libcorn).
View the crate [here](https://crates.io/crates/libcorn).

### JavaScript

The `libcorn` library includes WASM support, allowing you to use the native parser in Node.js and browser environments.

> When running under Node.js you will require `--experimental-modules` for versions `<= 16`.
> On all versions you require `--experimental-wasm-modules`.

Add the latest version of `libcorn` from NPM to your project:

```shell
npm i --save libcorn
# or
yarn add libcorn
# or
pnpm add libcorn
```

The library exposes a single `parse` function, which will produce a `Map`.
Parser errors are exposed in the JS environment and can be caught in the standard manner.

```js
import * as corn from 'libcorn';

const parsed = corn.parse('{foo = "bar"}');
console.log(parsed); // Map(foo -> "bar")
```

View the package [here](https://www.npmjs.com/package/libcorn).

### Lua

The `libcorn` library includes Lua binding support, allowing you to use the native parser.

> Currently, Lua requires manual compilation.
> You must have Lua installed, and compile targeting the installed version.

Clone the repo and build with Lua support:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/jakestanger/corn
cd corn
cargo build -p libcorn --release --features lua54
```

The following Lua versions are available - change the above feature depending on the target version.

- `lua51`
- `lua52`
- `lua53`
- `lua54`
- `luajit`
- `luajit52`

Next copy `target/release/libcorn.so` to your Lua project working dir.
The library can then be used as follows:

```lua
local libcorn = require("libcorn")

local success, res = pcall(libcorn.parse, '{foo = "bar"}')
if success then
    print(res.foo) -- lua table
else
    print(res) -- pretty printed error
end

```

## Editor support

## The basics

> Throughout the rest of this guide, you will see tabbed code blocks.
> These take the Corn input, parse it using the `libcorn` JavaScript bindings detailed above,
> and produce the outputted JSON/YAML/TOML automatically.

Corn is written inside `.corn` files.

Beginning with the obligatory hello world example:

<CodeBlock>
```corn
{ value = "hello world" }
```
</CodeBlock>

Every Corn file contains a single top-level object.
Inside that object, much like JSON, are key/value pairs.

Keys are not quoted and can contain any UTF-8 characters (yes, including emoji...) except whitespace, dots `.` and equals `=`.
Dots are a special case that we'll see later on.

Line comments are supported with `//`.

Values can be any type, again much like JSON:

<CodeBlock>
```corn
{
  a = "hello world" // string
  b = 123 // integer
  c = 3.14 // float
  d = false // boolean
  e = null // null
  f = { } // object
  g = [ ] // array
}
```
</CodeBlock>

Note no punctuation is needed between keys.

> Corn is very lenient on whitespace and in many places it can be omitted.
> Keys can all be on one line so long as there is separation between a key and the previous value.

Arrays work in much the same way:

<CodeBlock>
```corn
{
  array = [ "one fish" "two fish" "red fish" "blue fish" ]
}
```
</CodeBlock>

Of course, you can mix types including objects in arrays and arrays in objects in any combination to any depth.

<CodeBlock>
```corn
{
  array = [
    "one fish"
    "two fish"
    "red fish"
    {
      complex_fish = true
      name = "Barry"
      age = 2
      eats = [ "other fish" "algae" ]
    }
  ]
}
```
</CodeBlock>

## Features

So far, you've seen Corn's basic syntax.
You're probably thinking it looks pretty close to all the others, so what makes it special?
This next section aims to show the cool stuff that answers that.

The functionality available is kept purposely simple, with the belief that if you need more, you're probably using the wrong tool.
The few tools available to you here though should prove very powerful.

### Key chaining

The first and simplest of the features allows you to chain keys with `dot.notation` to create nested objects instantly.
Chains can be as long as you like, and you can mix/match the two syntaxes as you please.
Everything is automatically put in the right place.

<CodeBlock>
```corn
{
  foo = {
    qux = "hello world"
  }

  foo.bar.baz = 123
}
```
</CodeBlock>

### Inputs

You can optionally write a `let { } in` block before the top-level object.
This allows you to declare "input" values, which are effectively constants.

Every input declaration and reference starts with a dollar `$`, making them easy to spot.

Inputs can be of any value type, and you can use inputs in place of values at any time.

<CodeBlock>
```corn
let {
  $myValue = 1234
} in {
  foo = $myValue
}
```
</CodeBlock>

You can also reference inputs from other inputs:

<CodeBlock>
```corn
let {
  $myValue = 1234
  $myValueArray = [ $myValue ]
} in {
  foo = $myValueArray
}
```
</CodeBlock>

You can also 'environment inputs', using the `$env_` prefix,
which read their value from environment variables.
These do not need to be declared, although you can to provide a fallback.

<CodeBlock>
```corn
let {
    // this is not required if `MY_VALUE` env var is set -
    // no vars can be set in the wasm environment, so the outputs fallback :(
    $env_MY_VALUE = "fallback"
} in {
    my_path = $env_MY_VALUE
}
```
</CodeBlock>

### Interpolation & Merging

Inputs can be taken a step further, with some basic capabilities to compose more complex values.

With strings, you can interpolate string-type inputs into the values.
You can escape interpolation with a backslash `\`.

<CodeBlock>
```corn
let {
  $greeting = "hello"
  $subject = "world"
} in {
  message = "$greeting, $subject"
  escaped = "\$greeting, \$subject"
}
```
</CodeBlock>

You can merge object inputs into other objects values, and array inputs into other array values.
This allows you to use complex inputs as a 'base' where you may need to add or change a few fields.

This is done using the `..$input` syntax.

<CodeBlock>
```corn
let {
    $baseObj = { a = "hello" }
    $baseArr = [ "one fish" "red fish" ]
} in {
    full = {
        ..$baseObj
        b = "world"
        c = [ ..$baseArr "red fish" "blue fish" ]
    }
}
```
</CodeBlock>
<br />

> You can merge anywhere in an object or array. You can also re-declare keys from merged objects.
> Since keys and merges are evaluated in order, this allows you to overwrite properties.

## Practical example

The following example is lifted from my [ironbar](https://github.com/jakestanger/ironbar) config file.
It makes heavy use of inputs and their advanced functionalities, as well as some key chaining,
to cut down on duplicated content and boilerplate.

<CodeBlock>
```corn
let {
    $workspaces = {
        type = "workspaces"
        all_monitors = false
        name_map = {
            1 = "󰙯"
            2 = ""
            3 = ""
            4 = ""
            5 = ""
        }
    }

    $launcher = {
        type = "launcher"
        favorites = [ "firefox" "discord" "steam" ]
        show_names = false
        show_icons = true
    }

    $mpd_base = { type = "music" player_type = "mpd" music_dir = "/home/jake/Music" }
    $mpd_local = { ..$mpd_base name = "music-local" }
    $mpd_server = { ..$mpd_base name = "music-server" host = "media-server:6600" }

    $sys_info = {
        type = "sys_info"
        format = ["{cpu_percent}% " "{memory_percent}% "]
        interval.cpu = 1
    }

    $tray = { type = "tray" }
    $clock = { type = "clock" }

    $clipboard = { type = "clipboard" max_items = 5 truncate.mode = "end" truncate.length = 30 }

    $cmd_shutdown = "shutdown now"
    $cmd_reboot = "reboot"

    $power_btn_base = { type = "button" class="power-btn" }

    $power_menu = {
        type = "custom"
        class = "power-menu"

        bar = [ { type = "button" name="power-btn" label = "" on_click = "popup:toggle" } ]

        popup = [ {
            type = "box"
            orientation = "vertical"
            widgets = [
                { type = "label" name = "header" label = "Power menu" }
                {
                    type = "box"
                    name = "buttons"
                    widgets = [
                        { ..$power_btn_base label = "<span font-size='20pt'></span>" on_click = "!$cmd_shutdown" }
                        { ..$power_btn_base label = "<span font-size='20pt'></span>" on_click = "!$cmd_reboot" }
                    ]
                }
            ]
        } ]
    }

    $start = [ $workspaces $launcher ]
    $end = [
        $mpd_local
        $mpd_server
        $sys_info
        $clipboard
        $power_menu
        $clock
    ]

    $base = {
        start = $start
        end = $end
        icon_theme = "Paper"
    }
} in {
    monitors = {
        DP-1 = { name = "DP-1" ..$base }
        DP-2 = { name = "DP-2" ..$base }
    }
}
```
